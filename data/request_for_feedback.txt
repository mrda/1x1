Hi Project Managers and Stakeholders,

Next week I have 1x1s with the following staff: 
* Monday: <NAME_1>
* Tuesday: <NAME_2>
* Wednesday: <NAME_3>
* Thursday: <NAME_4>
* Friday: <NAME_5>

What I'm looking for from you is feedback from you about how these individuals are performing on your projects - both in the tasks they perform and the behaviours they are exhibiting.

I'm looking for positive feedback on things they are doing well, in addition to opportunities for improvement that we can work on to make them more effective in their job.

If you can have this feedback to me via return email by EOD <COMPLETION_DATE> that would be greatly appreciated! 

Thanks in advance,

<YOUR_NAME>
