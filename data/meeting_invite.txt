When we meet for our 1x1 together, I'd like you to come prepared to talk about the following:

* Summarise what you've been working on lately in 10 minutes.  Tell me about the challenges you've faced, and how you've overcome them.  Tell me where you need help.

* Share your successes with me.  Let's celebrate how you're succeeding.

* Present your ideas.  How can we do things better on your project?  How can we do things better at Aligent?  Let's discuss!

* What do I need to know?
** How are your co-workers travelling?
** How are you travelling?
** How is your project going, really?
** How am I doing in supporting you?

* What are your career goals? Where do you want to go?
